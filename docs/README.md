# MeshDMXNode v0.1

This project provides a firmware system for ESP32-based LED + DMX mesh nodes. Each node:

- Can act as an Art-Net receiver
- Joins a dynamic ESP-Mesh network
- Has a WebUI for configuration
- Can optionally be a mesh root
- Stores settings in NVS
- Will eventually support dynamic effects and DMX override modes
